<h2><a name="WhatIsIt">What is it</a></h2>
<p>XL-FileTools provides a bunch of functions for files, grouped in three categories:</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Category</td>
<td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Functions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>List</td>
<td>There are two types: list of folders and files and list of extensions.<br>
- List of files produces a tab of informations about files that can include full 
path, filename, MD5 hash, SHA1 hash, Last accessed or modified date and number of 
lines if it's a text file.<br>
- List of extensions enumerate and calculate the number of extensions in a 
folder.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Copy/Move</td>
<td>Copy and move the selected folders and files. Duplicates (based on the MD5 
hash) can be excluded. The most interesting thing about using XL-FileTools to 
copy or move files is filters. Filters can be used with any function, but copy 
and move would be worthless without it. You can filter by file size, last 
accessed or modified date, using a keyword or regex, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rename</td>
<td>There are three types: By hash (MD5 or SHA1), By sort or Replace-By.<br>
- By hash simply renames file based on the calculated MD5 or SHA1 hash value. 
Extension may be preserved or not.<br>
- By sort applies a sort to a list of files before renaming them with an 
incremental value. There a lot of options for type of sort and type of 
incremental value.<br>
- Replace-By can be used on filename or folder name. You can use keyword or 
regex.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Another interesting feature of XL-FileTools is preview mode. You can see what's gonna 
happen before doing it for real. See documentation for more details.</p>

<h2><a name="Translation">Translation</a></h2>
<h3>To translate XL-FileTools to other languages:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In <strong>Config</strong> Window, use the <strong>Export Lang.ini</strong> 
function. The file will be saved in the same directory of the tool;</li>
<li>Open the file in any text editor like Notepad;</li>
<li>Translate each expression at the right of the <strong>=</strong> symbol;</li>
<ul>
<li>The expression on the left side is used by the tool to identify the expression 
so do not change it. Also, be sure to have a space between the <strong>=</strong> symbol 
and your expression (ex. Key = Value);</li>
<li>Authorized characters are alphanumerics, spaces and these symbols: ",", ".", "-", 
"!", ",", "(" and ")". Any other character will be deleted;</li>
<li>For some controls, string length must be the same as original. A longer string could 
be truncated if it doesn't match the length of the field;</li>
<li>The value associated with the <strong>translatorName</strong> will be used in 
the <strong>About</strong> window to identify you as translator (if you want). You can 
also add your email or a short url (ex. YourName (youraddress@email.com));</li>
</ul>
<li>Restart the tool so the strings in <strong>Lang.ini</strong> will be used 
instead of the default language.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you translate the tool and you want to share, contact the author.</p>
<h3>Available translations:</h3>
<p>To install, save the appropriate <strong>Lang.ini</strong> file in the same 
directory of the tool.</p>
<p>No translation available for the moment.</p>
